My findings after examining the Player wins and losses and the Dealer losses I have found that there was 13 losses between the 10th, 13th and 15th at 5 and 8 am and 2pm on all 3 days and 8pm and 11pm on the 10th and 12th.
In all 13 of these losses Billy Jones was the dealer according to the dealer Schedules for the days that the losses occured. Simultaneously the one constant player during all of the losses was Mylie Schmidt. Because of this commonality I believe Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones to be colluding to scam the Lucky Duck Casino.
