### **Scenario**



*   Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work. \

*   Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones. \

*   Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone. \

*   Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications. \

*   You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

Step 1:  Measure and Set Goals



1. The potential risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices are as follows: 

    First of all is the potential risk of an employee using their personal device off the clock to download information that could contain malware that is later leaked onto the companies network.  An example of this would be a mobile game/app that is laced with malicious code that is stored in the same space that work is being conducted on as opposed to partitioning where work and non work are done. 


    Secondly if an employee is using the device they work with on a public unsecured wifi network , the data could be intercepted by a bad actor/hacker. This could happen by a bad actor using Man in the middle attacks and Endpoint attacks for example. 

2. The preferred employee behavior would be to not use the same device they use for work on public unsecured wifi networks.  Another preferred employee behavior would be to only download apps and programs from reputable sources/companies. If an employee must use an unsecured wifi network they should use a vpn to securely connect to the network. 
3. One method to evaluate who is using their computers on unsecure networks is to conduct a survey to see how many people use their computers at airports, cafes and other areas that use public wifi. The survey would ask questions along the lines of “do you use your computer at these locations” and include a checklist of locations one might use their computer.  Another method would be to conduct a survey with a list of apps and programs that are known to be high risk and potentially contain malware. Both of these surveys would have to be worded as covertly as possible as to mitigate the number of employees who could potentially lie on the survey forms. 

    Another measure would be to have activity monitoring software/detection programs run on the company network to detect unwanted programs or files via malicious hashes that have a tendency to be downloaded from risky areas. The moment a computer with these unwanted files and/or programs connects, the security team and CISO will be notified. In addition to this the IT/Security departments should issue fake phish’s that log the IP address and other identifying information such as asset names of users who click the link and successfully have their details logged. This would give aggregate data of which users are using secure connections and which are not. This would in turn aid monitoring the percentage of people who use their own devices on public wifi networks and other unsecured locations without VPNS and other security measures. 

4. The goal for the organization to reach regarding people using their personal devices would be to have around 10 percent of the employees using their personal devices for work purposes from remote locations that are insecure in the first year of implementing these new monitoring and enforcement policies. By the end of the second year the goal will be to have less than 5 percent. 

Step 2. Who at the Company needs to be Employed 

HR Department: The HR teams responsibilities and role would be to enforce disciplinary action against individuals within the organization who are spotted using their devices on public unsecure wifi or downloading potentially malicious software. HR would step in at 2 different levels depending on if the employee is a first time offender or a repeat offender. If it is the first time the employee is caught , they will defer to the IT department to strip the employee of credentials and if it is not the HR department will determine if more disciplinary actions are required. 

CISO: The CISO would be in charge of drafting parameters of what is determined appropriate places to connect, inappropriate places to connect. The CISO in conjunction with the CIO will also on the technology side adapt detection overarching policy from the IT department in monitoring and detecting employees connecting over insecure connections and downloading suspicious/risky files and programs. 

CIO: The Chief Information Officer would work in tandem with the CISO in drafting overarching policies for the IT department to monitor and detect insecure connections that are made to SilverCorps Network.  The CIO will also determine appropriate programs for detection and implementation of monitoring. 

IT/Security Department: The IT Department would be responsible for enforcing monitoring and detection protocols in order to detect malware on computers connected to the business network. Additionally the IT department would also enforce the training and retraining of individuals as necessary by removing or adjusting credentials and access to the organization’s network until such training and retraining is complete.

CFO: The CFO’s Role would be to greenlight expenditures necessary to implement the new training programs in addition to any new programs and security measures that would be necessary to launch the phishing campaign and detect risky behavior. 

CEO: The CEO as the head of the organization would have to also give approval of the initiative. If the CEO does not agree with the initiative then the training program would be unable to be enacted by all of the above parties. 

Step 3. The Training Plan

The title of the training sessions/program will be called “The Do’s and Don’ts of BYOD” 

First of all, establishing who the target audience and their needs are: The target audience for this course are employees among the entire organization. Their need is to be educated about the risks of using their own devices for work purposes. 

The Training program will take place in 3 phases. 

The first phase will involve training all current employees via in person training seminars led by a combination of people from HR and IT to explain to employees the risks of both connecting to public and unsecured wifi networks. The training seminars will take place in presentation format.  Specifically the presentation will cover the different types of attacks that can happen while connected to an unsecured wifi network at public locations such as an airport or public cafe such as starbucks. The training seminar will also explain ways to mitigate risks of connecting to unsecured wifi networks if it must be done by use of VPN and other methods. Finally the Seminar will also educate employees on files and malware. This will be done in increments of 25 people in one and a half hour sessions. By the end of the training seminars the trained employees will be aware of what kinds of connections they should and shouldn’t connect to, the dangers of using unsecure connections and the different kinds of attacks they could be victim to. They will also be aware of the dangers of downloading files from unknown sources and the types of malware that they (and by extension the network) can be exposed to in the process. The reasons these topics are being chosen is to raise awareness of the risks of using insecure networks and downloading from untrustworthy sources. Employees may be aware of the overarching dangers but may be unaware of how easy it is to have their information exposed to bad actors. They may believe that it is something that happens but it would never happen to them. This training seminar will also be a reality check for many employees. 

The second phase of this will involve an exam that involves questions deliberating scenarios as to what connections and use of personal devices is acceptable or not. These questions will be multiple choice and fill in the blanks. 

Sample questions listed below. 

What location is considered a secure place to connect to the internet \
 \
A. A Cafe 

B. An airport with an open wifi network

C. A private password protected Wifi network at private residence

D. A mobile hotspot

Once someone passes the exam with a score of 75 percent or higher, the person will be considered trained. If the person fails they will be given study material and asked to complete the exam again at their workspace in their own time. In the meantime the IT department will have their privileges reduced or revoked until the exam is passed (I.e. They will be unable to use their own device until they pass).

The third phase will start once everyone who is currently employed at Silvercorp have been trained and have successfully passed an exam. This phase will be ongoing and will be continuous.  The IT department will continue to launch fake Phish campaigns targeting all employees throughout the year to capture information about where the users are logging in from and if they are following training protocol. If they are connected from an unsecure connection/location without the use of a VPN they will be reported to HR where a course of action will take place depending on whether it is their first offense or not. If it is, they will have their credentials and access restricted until they review a training video akin to the training seminar they took initially and pass another exam. As this is done HR and IT departments will review who passes and fails these fake phishes and examine if the number of people failing is higher or lower than before the training program.

 All new hires to SilverCorp will be required to either also review the training video previously mentioned and any future offenders will also have to review the training video and materials and pass an exam in order to maintain access to their login credentials. Any repeat offenders to the company will either be required to no longer use their own devices or potential disciplinary action not limited probation or termination of employment. 

As these 3 phases are conducted the IT department will continue to monitor the activity of the network, the types of connections that are being made and scan for any malware on the network.  The success of the training will be determined if the number of breaches and people who fail fake phishes decreases below or within a margin of 10 percent.
